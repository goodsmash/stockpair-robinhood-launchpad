# StockPair v0.6.0 — Complete Final Handoff

This is the single consolidated handoff for the StockPair v0.6.0 final security, UI, local-development, GitHub and Vercel release. It intentionally repeats the complete release statement so no material claim exists only in chat.

## Release identity

- Product: StockPair Robinhood Chain-compatible market application.
- Release: `0.6.0`.
- Protocol label: `STOCKPAIR_LAUNCHPAD_V0.6.0`.
- Status: `PASS_WITH_EXTERNAL_AUDIT_TARGET_CHAIN_ACCOUNT_AND_MANAGED_BROWSER_GATES`.
- Purpose: hardened local/testnet deployment candidate with a responsive browser application, Solidity protocol, read-only REST/SSE indexer, Chain Scout, Vercel handoff, GitHub automation and complete operator/agent documentation.
- This release is not affiliated with or endorsed by Robinhood.
- This release is not an independent audit, legal approval, recovery mechanism, production authorization or guarantee against future vulnerabilities.
- Existing v0.3, v0.4 and v0.5 deployments are not upgraded in place. v0.6 requires a new independently verified deployment.

The machine-readable source of truth is [`RELEASE_VERIFICATION.json`](RELEASE_VERIFICATION.json). The file-by-file inventory is [`release-manifest.json`](release-manifest.json), and individual file hashes are in [`SHA256SUMS`](SHA256SUMS).

## Included product and user interface

The release contains a responsive desktop and mobile application with the following user surfaces:

- **Discover:** factory markets, reserves, fees, lock posture and risk state.
- **Trade:** exact-input swaps, proportional liquidity addition and self-directed liquidity removal.
- **Launch:** fixed-supply launch workflow with registry, runtime-code, oracle, value, allocation and lock checks.
- **Portfolio:** launch-token, stock-token and LP balances for a connected or inspected address.
- **Chain Scout:** bounded contract creation, ERC-20-like token, DEX pool/swap, exact-code-family, public-label and deployer-evidence discovery.
- **Risk Scanner:** bytecode, proxy-slot, privileged-selector, registry, source-verification and concentration evidence.
- **Activity:** launch, swap, liquidity and emergency-control event history.
- **Settings:** independent trust-anchor state, indexer posture, diagnostics export, support guidance and browser-local privacy controls.

The final interface includes:

- grouped desktop navigation and mobile navigation;
- wallet, indexer and SSE status indicators;
- deployment-posture and direct-chain trust status;
- loading, empty, blocked, degraded-data and error states;
- a clear distinction between a red direct on-chain execution lock and amber indexer-data degradation;
- exact-approval and decoded-transaction review controls;
- keyboard-contained review and deployer-evidence dialogs;
- initial dialog focus, Tab containment, Escape handling and prior-focus restoration;
- labelled dialog semantics and active-navigation `aria-current` state;
- visible keyboard focus indicators;
- mobile-height and internal-scroll constraints for review dialogs;
- reduced-motion support;
- diagnostics export and browser-local privacy reset;
- installable web-app metadata, icons, social preview and boot screen; and
- public administration disabled by default.

UI architecture and behavior are documented in:

- [`docs/UI_AND_USER_FLOWS.md`](docs/UI_AND_USER_FLOWS.md)
- [`docs/UI_SECURITY_MODEL.md`](docs/UI_SECURITY_MODEL.md)
- [`docs/USER_ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md`](docs/USER_ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md)

## Confirmed exploit classes closed in v0.6

### 1. Hostile indexer and SSE injection

Earlier browser code relied too heavily on TypeScript casting while rendering indexer-controlled values. A compromised or poisoned indexer could potentially submit malicious markup, invalid values or dangerous explorer links.

v0.6 now:

- treats every REST and SSE value as `unknown` until runtime-normalized;
- validates and bounds addresses, hashes, numeric strings, identifiers, findings, labels, evidence records, deployer graphs, portfolio rows, pool rows and swap rows;
- normalizes risk levels to an explicit allowlist;
- rejects `javascript:` URLs, credential-bearing URLs, malformed origins and control characters;
- reconstructs explorer links from reviewed HTTPS origins rather than trusting arbitrary URLs;
- rejects oversized REST responses and oversized SSE events;
- validates expected JSON content types;
- keeps scanner/Scout discovery non-authoritative for execution; and
- prevents a poisoned feed from silently changing the direct-chain execution state.

Evidence:

- [`docs/V0.6.0_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`](docs/V0.6.0_SECURITY_REVIEW.md)
- [`docs/UI_SECURITY_MODEL.md`](docs/UI_SECURITY_MODEL.md)
- [`qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/final-quick-clean.log`](qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/final-quick-clean.log)

### 2. Compromised-frontend deadline and slippage abuse

The earlier protocol relied partly on the frontend to select safe transaction deadlines and minimum outputs. A compromised frontend could attempt long-lived transactions or weak slippage protection while still calling a legitimate pool.

v0.6 moves these safety requirements on-chain:

- maximum transaction deadline window: **30 minutes**;
- maximum swap-minimum looseness: **3%** from the current contract quote;
- maximum liquidity-minimum looseness: **1%** from contract previews;
- maximum swap input: **5% of the input reserve**; and
- token recipient remains bound to the transaction actor.

The deployed-bytecode compromised-frontend regression proves unsafe deadlines and loose minimum outputs are rejected while properly bounded transactions remain possible.

Evidence:

- [`qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-frontend-compromise.log`](qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-frontend-compromise.log)
- [`qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-summary.json`](qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-summary.json)

### 3. Governance, eligibility and ownership recovery abuse

v0.6 removes immediate recovery authority for sensitive eligibility and ownership operations:

- attestor and guardian changes require an exact-action **48-hour delay**;
- recovery actions have a seven-day execution window;
- guardians can cancel queued recovery actions;
- pending ownership acceptance expires after seven days;
- eligibility authorization expires within 30 days;
- emergency denial remains immediately available for incident containment; and
- emergency-denial clearing is delayed rather than immediately owner-controlled.

Evidence:

- [`qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-eligibility-governance.log`](qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-eligibility-governance.log)
- [`qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-timelock.log`](qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-timelock.log)

### 4. Non-exact approvals and incomplete pool provenance

Before an approval or write, the browser independently proves:

- chain ID;
- exact factory address and runtime hash;
- launchpad protocol version;
- factory pool-registration record;
- pool protocol version and initialization state;
- exact token pair and fee;
- launch record;
- launch-token issuer and protocol version;
- metadata commitment;
- stock-token runtime hash and policy state;
- oracle configuration and freshness;
- emergency state; and
- caller-bound recipient identity.

Approvals must be exactly equal to the required amount, use zero-first replacement when necessary, and attempt residual allowance revocation after liquidity use or a failure path. A compromised indexer cannot substitute a different spender and obtain authorization solely from API data.

Evidence:

- [`docs/UI_SECURITY_MODEL.md`](docs/UI_SECURITY_MODEL.md)
- [`docs/SCANNER_AND_EXECUTION_GATE.md`](docs/SCANNER_AND_EXECUTION_GATE.md)
- [`apps/web/src/main.ts`](apps/web/src/main.ts)
- [`apps/web/src/lib/security.ts`](apps/web/src/lib/security.ts)

### 5. Strict stock-asset runtime policy

Strict asset admission rejects stock-token contracts with unsafe or ambiguous behavior, including:

- fee-on-transfer behavior;
- reentrant token callbacks;
- privileged mint controls;
- blacklist or tax controls;
- proxies and delegate execution;
- `DELEGATECALL`;
- `CALLCODE`;
- `SELFDESTRUCT`;
- jump-over-`INVALID` evasions; and
- executable fake-metadata evasions.

The scanner evaluates the full runtime rather than trusting apparent metadata boundaries.

- [`qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-reentrancy.log`](qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-reentrancy.log)

### 6. Liquidity, creator and emergency controls

The protocol retains and verifies:

- creator allocation limited to **10%**;
- creator vesting with a long-term custody model;
- initial LP liquidity locked for at least **one year**;
- oracle-denominated minimum initial stock value;
- pool outputs sent only to the transaction actor;
- global pause and timelocked delisting blocking new risk; and
- self-directed LP withdrawal preserved under pause or delisting.

## Verification completed

The final release evidence records the following completed checks:

- **100,000** deterministic swap cases preserving constant-product invariants and preventing output-reserve drain;
- **10,000** monotonic quote cases;
- **50,000** proportional liquidity mint/burn cases that did not overpay reserves;
- **160,000** total AMM and liquidity property cases;
- **37** Solidity files passing structural validation;
- **48** source files passing static-security validation;
- **8** scanner bypass regressions;
- **3** indexer perimeter and SSE regressions;
- **7** UI security, responsive and accessibility contract tests;
- live Chain Scout detection of an actually deployed ERC-20-like contract;
- TypeScript validation;
- production Vite build;
- Vercel production-environment validation;
- production CSP generation with no localhost production targets;
- source-matched Solidity artifact validation;
- browser ABI matching generated Solidity artifacts byte-for-byte;
- root/indexer runtime dependency audit: **0 known vulnerabilities** at verification time;
- browser runtime dependency audit: **0 known vulnerabilities** at verification time;
- GitHub workflow YAML and deployment JSON parsing;
- archive integrity and release hygiene; and
- **13/13** isolated deployed-bytecode security scenarios.

The 13 completed EVM scenarios are:

1. launch provenance, bounded trade, creator vesting and one-year LP custody;
2. global pause preserving self-directed LP withdrawal;
3. timelocked stock delisting preserving self-directed LP withdrawal;
4. creator-allocation cap and lock-floor enforcement;
5. fee-on-transfer stock rejection with atomic rollback;
6. reentrant token callback rejection;
7. stale and invalid oracle-round rejection;
8. full-runtime bytecode-policy evasion rejection;
9. compromised-frontend deadline and slippage abuse rejection;
10. eligibility and ownership recovery-delay enforcement;
11. mandatory administration delay and guardian cancellation;
12. privileged-mint and delegate-proxy asset rejection; and
13. vesting, minimum stock value, self-recipient and maximum-swap enforcement.

Only isolated TAP logs with a nonzero pass count and zero failures are counted. Ganache emitted an optional native µWS compatibility warning under Node 22 and used its JavaScript fallback. That can reduce local test speed but is not part of the production browser or deployed contract runtime.

Primary evidence:

- [`RELEASE_VERIFICATION.json`](RELEASE_VERIFICATION.json)
- [`docs/SECURITY_TEST_REPORT.md`](docs/SECURITY_TEST_REPORT.md)
- [`qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-summary.json`](qa/verification-logs-v0.6.0/e2e-summary.json)
- [`qa/V0.6.0_VERIFICATION.txt`](qa/V0.6.0_VERIFICATION.txt)

## Full local launch

Requirements:

- Node.js `22.x`;
- npm `10.x`;
- a loopback-capable local environment.

Run:

```bash
npm run setup
npm run local
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

The local command launches:

- disposable local EVM: `127.0.0.1:8545`;
- read-only REST API and Chain Scout: `127.0.0.1:8787`;
- browser application: `127.0.0.1:5173`; and
- a seeded factory market for user-flow testing.

Stop the stack with `Ctrl+C`. Never fund the deterministic local accounts.

After intentionally modifying Solidity, run:

```bash
npm run local:fresh
```

`npm run setup` validates packaged compiler artifacts against the exact Solidity source bundle. `local:fresh` recompiles intentionally changed contracts and regenerates the browser ABI.

The completed local smoke test verified:

- indexer version `0.6.0`;
- chain ID `31337` under a narrowly scoped disposable-local acknowledgement;
- exact factory runtime hash and protocol-version match;
- trusted factory configuration;
- one seeded launch;
- active Scout coverage with deployed contracts and tokens;
- HTTP delivery of the UI;
- REST API health; and
- an SSE response with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, no-cache, MIME protection, frame denial, restrictive policy and API-version headers.

Generated `.env.local`, local deployment addresses and disposable processes were removed after evidence collection. The final default browser bundle was rebuilt after cleanup.

- [`docs/LOCAL_DEMO.md`](docs/LOCAL_DEMO.md)

## Vercel deployment handoff

The repository is structured for Vercel import from the repository root.

- `vercel.json` builds and publishes `apps/web/dist`.
- Production builds validate the chain, factory address, factory runtime hash, protocol version, HTTPS origins and explicit deployment acknowledgement.
- Production CSP generation rejects localhost and embedded credentials.
- The browser defaults to same-origin/fail-closed indexer behavior.
- Public operations remain disabled unless all exact trust anchors are configured.
- Vercel hosts the static frontend only.
- The long-running REST/SSE indexer must be hosted separately with the included unprivileged container definition.

Build command:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/web run build:vercel
```

- CI workflows;
- isolated EVM matrices;
- Foundry and Slither workflow definitions;
- CodeQL;
- dependency review;
- Dependabot;
- pull-request and issue templates;
- tagged release packaging;
- generated production frontend inclusion in release artifacts; and
- agent and operator continuation rules.

Repository owners must configure branch protection, required checks, environments, reviewers/CODEOWNERS, private vulnerability reporting, release signing and organization-specific secret policy in GitHub settings.

The launchpad runtime remains below the EIP-170 runtime-size limit according to the recorded compiler output.

## Release hygiene

The release archive excludes:

- `node_modules`;
- `.git` history;
- local deployment state;
- `.env.local` and other environment files;
- private keys;
- seed phrases;
- keystores;
- temporary browser/server processes;
- generated disposable chain state; and
- temporary archives.

The manifest records every included file and its SHA-256. The external archive checksum is distributed beside the ZIP because an archive cannot include its own final checksum without changing that checksum.

## Historical incident boundary

The reported historical user loss is acknowledged, but its exact root cause is not proven because the following evidence was not provided:

- attack transaction hashes;
- affected deployed addresses;
- compromised frontend bundle and exact hash;
- DNS/CDN/CI audit logs;
- signer logs; and
- RPC logs.

This release:

- does not recover completed transfers;
- does not patch immutable historical deployments;
- does not identify the attacker;
- does not prove the historical exploit path; and
- does not guarantee the absence of unknown vulnerabilities.

Incident and forensic documents:

- [`docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`](docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md)
- [`docs/FORENSIC_EVIDENCE_INTAKE.md`](docs/FORENSIC_EVIDENCE_INTAKE.md)
- [`docs/V0.3.0_SECURITY_POSTMORTEM.md`](docs/V0.3.0_SECURITY_POSTMORTEM.md)
- [`docs/V0.4.0_MIGRATION.md`](docs/V0.4.0_MIGRATION.md)

## External gates and remaining work

The following were not completed in this environment and remain mandatory before real-value operation:

- independent smart-contract and economic audit;
- independent browser, indexer and infrastructure penetration testing;
- live Robinhood Chain target-chain deployment;
- target-chain reorg, RPC-failure and failover testing;
- real Vercel account deployment;
- real GitHub repository push and organization-level controls;
- Docker image build and image scanning because Docker was unavailable;
- local Foundry and Slither execution because those CLIs were unavailable, although workflow definitions are included;
- production hardware-backed multisig and guardian configuration;
- production monitoring, alerting, durable archive indexing and RPC failover;
- incident-response rehearsal;
- legal, RWA/securities, sanctions, privacy and jurisdictional approval;
- forensic attribution or historical fund recovery; and
- managed-device visual/browser-console validation.

The managed Chromium environment used during verification blocked localhost, private-network and `file:` navigation before the page loaded. Static UI contracts, accessibility behavior, production compilation and actual UI HTTP delivery passed. No automated screenshot or zero-browser-console-error claim is made.

## Recommended release workflow

1. Review this document and `RELEASE_VERIFICATION.json`.
2. Confirm the external ZIP checksum.
3. Initialize a clean Git repository from this archive.
4. Run `npm run setup` and `npm run local`.
5. Run `npm run compile` and `npm run verify` after any source change.
6. Run all 13 isolated EVM scenarios and retain only complete zero-failure TAP logs.
7. Complete independent audits and remediate all findings.
8. Deploy a fresh protocol through separate hardware-backed multisig and guardian roles.
9. Verify the exact chain, factory runtime hash, protocol versions and child-component links.
10. Deploy the read-only indexer separately from the Vercel static frontend.
11. Configure production RPCs, origins, branch protection, monitoring and incident response.
12. Perform target-chain and managed-browser acceptance testing before enabling real operations.

## Final statement

StockPair v0.6.0 is a complete hardened source and deployment-handoff candidate with a full user interface, deterministic local stack, Vercel/GitHub configuration, read-only indexer/Scout, contract-level transaction safeguards, runtime hostile-data validation, exploit regressions, machine-readable QA evidence and agent/operator guides.

It is ready for controlled local evaluation, independent audit, fresh target-chain deployment preparation and authorized account setup. It is not represented as unhackable, already production-certified, historically loss-recovering or safe for real-value operation without the external gates listed above.
